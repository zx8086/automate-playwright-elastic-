# PLAYWRIGHT ELASTIC SYNTHETICS AUTOMATION - ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# This file contains all configurable settings for the press kit automation tool.
# Copy this file to `.env` and customize the values for your specific use case.
#
# The tool performs these main functions:
# 1. Navigates through press kit websites and discovers all available pages
# 2. Downloads assets (PDFs, images, videos) found on each page
# 3. Takes screenshots of each page for visual verification
# 4. Generates Elastic Synthetics tests for continuous monitoring
# =============================================================================

# =============================================================================
# SERVER & SITE CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# The target press kit website to analyze and monitor
# Example sites:
# - https://presskit.tommy.com/TommyHilfigerFA25Campaign/
# - https://presskit.tommy.com/TommyxU.S.SailGPTeamCollection/
# - https://presskit.calvin.com/CKJeans_SpringSummer2024/
BASE_URL=https://presskit.tommy.com/TommyHilfigerFA25Campaign/

# Directory where page screenshots and sitemap.html will be saved
# The tool creates a visual navigation map of all discovered pages
SCREENSHOT_DIR=./navigation-screenshots

# Directory where downloaded assets (PDFs, images, videos) will be stored
# Assets are organized and deduplicated automatically
DOWNLOADS_DIR=./downloads

# Directory where generated Elastic Synthetics tests will be created
# Contains both core.journey.ts and synthetics-data.json files
SYNTHETICS_DIR=./synthetics

# Delay between navigation actions (in milliseconds)
# Increase this value for slower websites or to be more respectful to servers
# Range: 500-5000ms (500ms = very fast, 2000ms = respectful, 5000ms = very slow)
PAUSE_BETWEEN_CLICKS=1000

# =============================================================================
# ELASTIC SYNTHETICS CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# These settings control how the generated Elastic Synthetics tests are configured
# and tagged for organization in your monitoring infrastructure

# Environment identifier (used in test names and tags)
# Common values: development, staging, production
ENVIRONMENT=production

# Department/team identifier (full name for tags)
# Examples: marketing_technology, digital_experience, brand_management
DEPARTMENT=marketing_technology

# Short department code (used in test names to keep them concise)
# Examples: MT (Marketing Technology), DE (Digital Experience), BM (Brand Management)
DEPARTMENT_SHORT=MT

# Domain/organization identifier (used for test organization)
# Examples: eu-shared-services, us-retail, asia-pacific
DOMAIN=eu-shared-services

# Service type identifier (what kind of monitoring this is)
# Examples: presskit, ecommerce, corporate-site, campaign-site
SERVICE=presskit

# Journey type (used in generated test names)
# Examples: PressKit, ECommerce, Navigation, UserFlow
JOURNEY_TYPE=PressKit

# =============================================================================
# BROWSER CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# These settings control how Playwright launches and operates the browser

# Run browser in headless mode (true) or with visible UI (false)
# Set to false for debugging and development, true for CI/CD environments
BROWSER_HEADLESS=false

# Browser viewport dimensions (affects screenshots and responsive behavior)
# Standard sizes: 1280x720 (720p), 1920x1080 (1080p), 1366x768 (laptop)
VIEWPORT_WIDTH=1280
VIEWPORT_HEIGHT=720

# Ignore HTTPS certificate errors (useful for development environments)
# Set to false in production for better security validation
IGNORE_HTTPS_ERRORS=true

# Enable screenshots in generated Synthetics tests
# Options: on, off, only-on-failure
SCREENSHOT_MODE=on

# Enable video recording in generated Synthetics tests
# Options: on, off, retain-on-failure
VIDEO_MODE=on

# Enable detailed execution traces in generated Synthetics tests
# Options: on, off, retain-on-failure
TRACE_MODE=on

# =============================================================================
# DOWNLOAD CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# Settings that control asset downloading behavior

# Maximum size for individual file downloads (in bytes)
# Default: 104857600 (100MB) - prevents downloading extremely large files
# Common sizes: 10485760 (10MB), 52428800 (50MB), 209715200 (200MB)
MAX_DOWNLOAD_SIZE=104857600

# =============================================================================
# VALIDATION CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# These settings control how thoroughly the tool validates discovered assets
# Higher numbers provide more comprehensive validation but slower execution

# Maximum number of images to validate for accessibility and loading
# The tool checks if images load properly and have valid dimensions
# Range: 50-500 (50 = basic validation, 200 = thorough, 500 = comprehensive)
MAX_IMAGES_TO_VALIDATE=200

# Maximum number of video assets to validate
# The tool verifies video links are accessible and properly formatted
# Range: 10-100 (10 = basic, 50 = thorough, 100 = comprehensive)
MAX_VIDEOS_TO_VALIDATE=50

# Enable comprehensive validation of asset page images
# When true: validates all images on asset pages for proper loading
# When false: skips detailed image validation (faster but less thorough)
VALIDATE_ASSET_IMAGES=true
